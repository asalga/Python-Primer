The purpose of this document is to give the reader a basic understanding of Python. Written by [Andor  Salga](https://asalga.wordpress.com)

To begin working with Python, go to the [official site](https://www.python.org/) and navigate to the download section.

## The Basics
Some things to keep in mind before starting your Python development:

 * Python is **not** free-form; indentation and whitespace has contextual significance
 * Python is case-sensitive


## Output
The first thing you need to know is how to write to the console. We do this by using **print**.

    print # prints and empty line
    print "Hello double quotations!"
    print 'Hello, single quotations!'



## Data Types
Python has five built-in data types:
* Number
* String
* List
* Tuple
* Dictionary



## Common String Operations


## Math Expressions
Python has a built-in method of raising numbers to an exponent.

    twoFiftySix = 2**8;
    
## Functions
    def function():
        return 42

## Variables


## Classes
